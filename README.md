This is a fork of the [FreeRTOS 202212.00](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/202212.00), in the intention of porting FreeRTOS to AFTx07, which is microcontroller of Purdue-SoCET orgs.

The source files are in the submodule from [FreeRTOS kernel](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel).

## Getting started
The dir of interested is FreeRTOS/Demo/AFTx07.

To understand the repo structure, please take a look at [FreeRTOS Source File Structure](https://www.freertos.org/a00017.html).

To understand RISCV porting, please look at [RISV Port](https://www.freertos.org/a00090.html#RISC-V).

To modify config file, please look at [FreeRTOSConfig.h](https://www.freertos.org/a00110.html).

## How to build
The building instruction is at dir FreeRTOS/Demo/AFTx07.
